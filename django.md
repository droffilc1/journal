### **API for a Digital Journal**

#### **Project Overview**

- **Purpose:** Build an API that allows users to create, manage, and organize their personal journal entries. The API will support basic CRUD operations, authentication, and tagging of entries.

#### **Core Features**

1. **User Authentication**
    
    - **Registration:** Users can create an account to access the journal.
    - **Login:** Users log in to manage their entries.
    - **Token Authentication:** Secure the API with token-based authentication.
2. **Journal Entries**
    
    - **Create Entry:** Users can create new journal entries, including a title, content, and tags.
    - **Read Entries:** Users can retrieve a list of their entries, or view a specific entry.
    - **Update Entry:** Users can update existing entries.
    - **Delete Entry:** Users can delete entries they no longer need.
3. **Tagging System**
    
    - **Tag Entries:** Users can tag their entries with relevant keywords.
    - **Filter by Tags:** Users can filter their entries based on tags.
4. **Search Functionality**
    
    - **Search Entries:** Implement a search feature that allows users to find entries by keywords in the title or content.
5. **Drafts and Publishing**
    
    - **Draft Mode:** Users can save entries as drafts before publishing.
    - **Publish Entry:** Users can publish a draft entry, making it visible in the main list.
6. **Journal Categories**
    
    - **Create Categories:** Users can categorize their journal entries (e.g., Work, Personal, Ideas).
    - **Assign Entries to Categories:** Users can assign entries to specific categories for better organization.

#### **Models**

1. **User Model**
    
    - **Attributes:**
        - `username`: User’s name.
        - `email`: User’s email address.
        - `password`: User’s hashed password.
2. **JournalEntry Model**
    
    - **Attributes:**
        - `user`: Foreign key linking the entry to a user.
        - `title`: Title of the journal entry.
        - `content`: The main content of the entry.
        - `created_at`: Timestamp of when the entry was created.
        - `updated_at`: Timestamp of the last update.
        - `is_draft`: Boolean indicating whether the entry is a draft or published.
3. **Tag Model**
    
    - **Attributes:**
        - `name`: The name of the tag.
        - `entries`: Many-to-many relationship with `JournalEntry` to allow multiple tags per entry.
4. **Category Model**
    
    - **Attributes:**
        - `name`: The name of the category.
        - `user`: Foreign key linking the category to a user.
        - `entries`: One-to-many relationship with `JournalEntry` to categorize entries.

#### **APIs to Implement**

1. **User Authentication**
    
    - **Register:** POST `/api/register/`
    - **Login:** POST `/api/login/`
    - **Token Authentication:** Use Django Rest Framework’s token authentication.
2. **Journal Entries**
    
    - **Create Entry:** POST `/api/entries/`
    - **List Entries:** GET `/api/entries/`
    - **Retrieve Entry:** GET `/api/entries/{id}/`
    - **Update Entry:** PUT `/api/entries/{id}/`
    - **Delete Entry:** DELETE `/api/entries/{id}/`
3. **Tags**
    
    - **List Tags:** GET `/api/tags/`
    - **Filter Entries by Tag:** GET `/api/entries/?tag={tag_name}`
4. **Categories**
    
    - **List Categories:** GET `/api/categories/`
    - **Assign Category to Entry:** PATCH `/api/entries/{id}/category/`
5. **Search**
    
    - **Search Entries:** GET `/api/entries/search/?q={query}`

This project is straightforward but involves a variety of DRF features, including authentication, CRUD operations, filtering, searching, and relational models. It’s a practical application that can be extended with more features as you get more comfortable with DRF.
